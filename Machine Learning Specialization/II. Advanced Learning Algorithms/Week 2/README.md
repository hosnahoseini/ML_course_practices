- Lab01: Introduce a new activation, the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU). 
- Lab02: Explore an example of multi-class classification using neural networks.
- Lab03: Explore the softmax function. This function is used in both Softmax Regression and in Neural Networks when solving Multiclass Classification problems.  
- Lab04: Use a neural network to recognize the hand-written digits 0-9.
