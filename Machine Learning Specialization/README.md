I. Supervised Machine Learning Regression and Classification
• Build machine learning models in Python using popular machine learning libraries NumPy and scikit-learn.
• Build and train supervised machine learning models for prediction and binary classification tasks, including linear regression and logistic regression

II. Advanced Learning Algorithms
• Build and train a neural network with TensorFlow to perform multi-class classification
• Apply best practices for machine learning development so that your models generalize to data and tasks in the real world
• Build and use decision trees and tree ensemble methods, including random forests and boosted trees

III. Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, Reinforcement Learning
• Use unsupervised learning techniques for unsupervised learning: including clustering and anomaly detection.
• Build recommender systems with a collaborative filtering approach and a content-based deep learning method.
• Build a deep reinforcement learning model.
